# MPI: Jacobi Iteration

This repository includes a solution for the 2D Laplace equation using the Jacobi Iteration method. The code explores different ways of parallelization using OpenMPI and OpenMP. 
The project was included in the course of Parallel Programming from the Modelling Master in Science and Engineering at Autonomou University of Barcelona and was developed by Pauline Mertens and Miquel Barcelona.


## Instructions
The src folder includes a Makefile prepared to compile the program depending on
the version
```bash
cd src/
make all version=00
